## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I went through the tutorial for Django.
I also looked for IoT boards and IR sensors online.
We discussed in more detail about what we need for the software side and divided up the work load to each person. 
Kaijian and I are going to work on receiving the data from the hardware team. 

## This Week's Plan

This week Kaijian and I are going to talk to the hardware team and figure out what kind of data we are getting from them.
Then, we will start working on a preliminary method to receive the data.

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing that is blocking our progress yet.
