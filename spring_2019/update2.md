## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I worked with Kaijian on caching the room occupancy data.
I looked at some other Django guides for more information.

## This Week's Plan

Get raspberry pi to send data to the server through HTTP
Maybe set up an actual server(instead of on localhost) and test receiving data

## Anything Blocking?

There is nothing that is blocking our progress yet.

## Notes

None
