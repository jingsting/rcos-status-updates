## Last Week's Accomplishments

- Reorganized the files in the repository and merged updates from master to dev_recv branch
- Did some more planning on our minimum viable product with the software group

## This Week's Plan

- Look for libraries for the IR sensor array and try them out with the test program
- Learn about running the programs in the background on Raspberry pi
